March Forward Quincy is a progressive group that encourages local engagement to increase civic interest locally and nationally, and engages our community to nurture empathy. We strive to fulfill our mission by providing information on political issues, highlighting means of action and engagement, and sponsoring events to connect to and unite our community.

March Forward Quincy is a name that highlights who we are, what we stand for, and where we come from. It also represents our intention to become a force of positivity and change in a world fraught with negativity and division.

Even after only a handful of meetings, our mission has become clear. Born from the Womenâ€™s March of January 21, 2017, March Forward Quincy encourages local engagement to increase civic interest locally and nationally, and engages our community to nurture empathy. We strive to fulfill our mission by providing information on political issues, highlighting means of action and engagement, and sponsoring events to connect to and unite our community. We are excited to start making progress and getting involved with our community.

On behalf of the Steering Committee, thank you for getting involved, for participating in our formative "Huddle" meetings, and for keeping the momentum of the Women's March alive.

At this time, endorsement of candidates is at the discretion of MFQ. Beginning in April 2024, we may approve posts regarding certain events and actions, in particular, those related to progressive issues/candidates. We may require a post to include the following statement at the top of the post: "This post does not represent endorsement of a candidate by March Forward Quincy." We are not at this time allowing endorsements of local candidates.

Thank you and we look forward to working with all of you, invite your suggestions, comments, ideas. With democracy hanging by a thread, we need your help to sew it up!

Stay tuned for action items, send us your ideas, and add your name to our mailing list at marchforwardquincy@gmail.com!
